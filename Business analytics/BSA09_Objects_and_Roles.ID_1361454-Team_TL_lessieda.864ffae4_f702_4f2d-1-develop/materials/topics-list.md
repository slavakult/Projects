Hello, School21 student! 😉

To help you navigate through the material, we have prepared a list of topics that you will learn in this project.

We will study:
- The life cycle of an object;
- Description of the object;
- Object Purpose;
- Object Attributes;
- Class diagram;
- Concept of class allocation.

Now that you know what to expect in this project, you can begin to study the topics listed above. 😇

We have also prepared a list of recommended software:
- Microsoft Word;
- Microsoft Visio.

Or you can use their analogues, for example, programs from the LibreOffice package and Google Docs. 

And there are programs similar to Visio for drawing diagrams: diagrams.net and LibreOffice Draw.
