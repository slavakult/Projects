Hello, School21 student! 😉

To help you navigate through the material, we have prepared a list of topics that you will learn in this project.

We will learn:
- Operations on an object;
- Characteristics of operations;
- Roles, role model, access rights;
- Life cycle of an entity;
- Verification.

Now that you know what awaits you in this project, you can slowly begin to study the topics listed above. 😇

We have also prepared a list of recommended software:
- Microsoft Word;
- Microsoft Excel;
- Microsoft Visio.

Or you can use their analogues, for example, programs from the LibreOffice package or Google Docs and Google Sheets. 

And there are programs similar to Visio for drawing diagrams: diagrams.net and LibreOffice Draw.
