Hello, student of School21!😉

To make it easier for you to navigate the material, we have prepared a list of topics that you will learn in this project.

We will study:
- Data presentation form;
- Roles and key scenarios;
- Screen forms.

Now, knowing what awaits you in this project, you can slowly begin to study the topics listed above.😇

We have also prepared a list of recommended software:
- Microsoft Visio;
- Microsoft Excel.

Or you can use their analogues, for example, programs from the LibreOffice package. 

And there are programs similar to Visio for drawing diagrams: diagrams.net and LibreOffice Draw.
